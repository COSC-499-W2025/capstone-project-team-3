Please use a branching workflow, and once an item is ready, do remember to issue a PR, review, and merge it into the master branch.
Be sure to keep your docs and README.md up-to-date.

### Building and running with Docker

Prereqs: Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine + docker-compose).

When you're ready, start your application by running:
`docker compose up --build`.

**To run the docker environment in the interactive environment, please run `docker compose run --rm -it --service-ports server python -m app.main`.**

Your application will be available at http://localhost:8000.

Quick helper script:
- `scripts/setup.sh` builds and runs the app. Options:
  - `USE_COMPOSE=1 ./scripts/setup.sh` to use docker compose
  - `PLATFORM=linux/amd64 ./scripts/setup.sh` to force platform

**Note:**
- **Make sure you have the docker daemon running in the background i.e. open the Docker app installed on your machine**
- **Make sure `requirements.txt` exists (Dockerfile installs from it).**
- **Keep Dockerfile and compose files tracked in git; use `.dockerignore` to exclude files from the build context.**

In the terminal, run the following command to stop the application: `docker compose down`.

### Database Setup with Docker ###

The project includes a basic SQL database initialization process that runs automatically when the application starts in Docker. This setup ensures that your database tables and schemas are created without manual intervention.

How It Works:

  The database initialization is handled by init_db() function inside app/data/db.py.

  When you run the application (`docker compose up --build`), the FastAPI server triggers this initialization to create the required tables.

  All SQL scripts and schema definitions should be stored inside the app/data/ directory to maintain consistency.

 # Local Development #
  First time use : 
  From the project root (where compose.yaml lives):
    `docker compose up --build`

  If everything is correct, you should see these logs in the terminal:
   ` Database initialized at: /app/app/data/app.sqlite3`
   ` Database started`
   `Seed data inserted successfully`
    `App started`
    `INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000`
  
  * If you modify the database schema or add new tables:

  # Stop any running containers
  `docker compose down`

  # Remove the old SQLite DB
  `rm app/data/app.sqlite3`

  # Rebuild and restart the containers
  `docker compose up --build`


### Accessing the Database

  Once you build/pull the container from docker, you can access and view the database in your code by using :

  `from data.db import get_connection`
  `conn = get_connection()`
  `cursor = conn.cursor()`
  `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM PROJECT")`
  `print(cursor.fetchall())`

  By default, the database file is created in the /app directory inside the container.

### Accessing the Database through CLI

  After composing the docker container run :
    `docker compose exec server sqlite3 app/data/app.sqlite3`

  Then run :
    `.tables`
    `SELECT * FROM <table name>;`
  You should see the seed test rows.

  Type `.exit` to leave SQLite.

### Viewing Database through SQLite-VScode Extension
   Install the extension through this link :
    `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite`

  Run command `>SQLite: Open Database` in the search bar and select the db file `app.sqlite3`

  You should see the database schema appear under the SQLITE EXPLORER TAB.

 From here you should be able to select a table and see an editor view of the given table.

### Running Tests in Docker Environment
To run all the python tests in the docker environment, run `docker compose exec server pytest`.

You might need to run this in a new terminal window after running `docker compose up --build`.

### How to Check Your Test Coverage

Test coverage shows how much of your code is actually tested by your unit tests. It helps you find parts of the code that **aren't tested yet**, so you can improve your tests and catch potential bugs.

To generate a test coverage report, run this command:

```
docker compose exec server pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html:/app/htmlcov
```

This will run your tests and create a detailed **HTML report** inside the `/app/htmlcov` folder.

To view the coverage report:

1. Open the `htmlcov/index.html` file in a web browser.
2. You’ll see a visual overview showing which lines of code are tested (highlighted in green) and which are not (highlighted in red).

### Deploying your application to the cloud

Build & run (single-image):
- Build: `docker build -t myapp .`
- Run: `docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env myapp`

If your cloud uses a different CPU architecture than your development
machine (e.g., you are on a Mac M1 and your cloud provider is amd64),
you'll want to build the image for that platform, e.g.:
`docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t myapp .`.

Then, push it to your registry, e.g. `docker push myregistry.com/myapp`.

Consult Docker's [getting started](https://docs.docker.com/go/get-started-sharing/)
docs for more detail on building and pushing.

## Setting Up Gemini API Key for LLM Features

To use the LLM-powered features in this project, you **must provide your own Gemini API key**.

1. **Get your Gemini API key:**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and create an API key for a "default gemini project".

2. **Create a `.env` file in your project root:**
   - Copy the example below into a new file named `.env` (do **not** commit your real key to GitHub by adding the .env in the .gitignore file):

     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your-gemini-api-key-here...
     ```

3. **Your `.env` file should look like:**
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your-gemini-api-key-here...

4. **Keep your `.env` file private:**  
- Do **not** share your API key or commit it to version control.

---

**Now you can use all LLM features in the project!**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting (Sumy + NLTK Integration)

### ⚠️ **1. Missing `punkt` Tokenizer**

If you see this warning:

```
  NLTK 'punkt' tokenizer not found locally.
```

It means your NLTK data folder is missing or was not cloned correctly.

**Fix:**

1. Verify the tokenizer exists at:

   ```
   app/utils/non_code_analysis/nltk_data/tokenizers/punkt
   ```
2. If missing, download manually once:

   ```bash
   python3 -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt', download_dir='app/utils/non_code_analysis/nltk_data')"
   ```
3. Re-run:

   ```bash
   python3 -m app.utils.non_code_analysis.non_code_analysis_utils
   ```

---

### 🧩 **2. SSL or Certificate Errors**

If you encounter an error like:

```
[nltk_data] Error loading punkt: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]>
```

You don’t need to fix your SSL certificates — this project already runs **offline**.
Just ensure you’re using the local copy of `nltk_data` provided in the repo (as configured in the code).

---

### 🧠 **3. Import Errors for `sumy`**

If running the module throws:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sumy'
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
