### Issue Descriptions for this week:

- **#227: Implement scanning flow to the project's main** 
- **#226: Fix analysis bugs and refactor code - Code Analysis Section** 
- **#228: Research and fine tune non LLM analysis - Code Analysis**

### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**  
  - Incorporated the scanning flow into the main project workflow, ensuring that all projects extracted from user ZIP uploads are scanned and registered before analysis.
  - Refactored code to treat all `.md` files as documentation for analysis consistency.
  - Improved error handling in the LLM class, providing more detailed and user-friendly error messages.
  - Fine-tuned Gemini prompts to ensure the LLM outputs only the required bullet points, improving summary clarity.
  - Wrote and executed new unit tests for the updated scanning and analysis flows.
  - Demoed last week's contributions to the team, clarifying the new flow and code structure.

- **In Progress this week:**  
  - Researching and implementing techniques to further fine-tune the non-LLM analysis for more accurate skill and framework extraction.
  - test integration of file scans into the main project flow, pending the merging of related tasks.
  - Monitoring and testing for edge cases in both LLM and non-LLM analysis.

---

### Additional Context (Optional)
- Integration of the file scans is still pending due to dependencies on previous tasks that need to be merged into the main flow.
- Collaboration with teammates has been effective, especially during code reviews and demos.

---

### Reflection

**What Went Well:**  
- Successfully integrated major features into the main workflow.
- Team collaboration and communication were strong, especially during the demo and review sessions.
- Refactoring and testing improved code quality and maintainability.

**What Could Be Improved:**  
- Addressing pending merges and integrations earlier in the week could help avoid bottlenecks.
- Allocating more time for research on non-LLM analysis techniques.

---

### Plan for Next Cycle
- Finalize and merge the file scan integration into the main flow.
- Continue fine-tuning and testing the local (non-LLM) analysis algorithm.
- Address any remaining edge cases and improve test coverage.
- Begin work on the next set of milestone features as assigned.
