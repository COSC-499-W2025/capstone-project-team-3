### Issue Descriptions
#294 – Add Security Scan Workflow in the Pipeline

Implemented automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and potential security risks. Configured workflow to run on pull requests and main branch commits.

#273 – Linking Non-Code File Verification Results to Code Parsing Logic

Established connection between non-code file verification outputs and code parsing logic. Ensured that validation results are properly passed to parsing modules for comprehensive analysis.

#293 – Add CI Pipeline for Automated Testing

Set up continuous integration pipeline with automated test execution. Configured test runners, coverage reporting, and failure notifications to maintain code quality standards.

#292 – Create the Plan for the Workflow

Designed comprehensive workflow plan for the CI/CD pipeline. Mapped out all stages including build, test, security scan, and deployment processes with clear integration points.

#164 – Integrate the Overall Project Flow

Worked on matching the inputs and outputs of independent flows to ensure compatibility between different modules. Focused on aligning data structures and interfaces across parsing, analysis, and reporting components.

#274 – Testing for Non Code Parsing Flow into Non-code Analysis

Developed and executed tests to validate the integration between non-code parsing and analysis modules. Verified data flow, error handling, and output consistency.

#254 – Integrate Non Code Parsing Flow into Non Code Analysis

Completed integration of non-code parsing pipeline into the analysis module. Established seamless data transfer and processing between parsing and analysis stages.

### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**
This week focused on CI/CD pipeline development and integration work. Successfully implemented security scan workflow and automated testing pipeline to improve code quality and security posture. Completed the integration of non-code parsing flow into the analysis module, establishing a complete pipeline for non-code file processing.

Created comprehensive workflow plan that maps out the entire CI/CD architecture, providing clear guidance for future development and maintenance. Testing for non-code parsing integration was completed successfully, validating the connection between parsing and analysis stages.

- **In Progress this week:**
  - #164: Integrate the overall project flow — worked on matching inputs and outputs of independent flows and making connections for the flow 

---

### Additional Context (Optional)
The main focus was on establishing robust CI/CD infrastructure and completing critical integration work. The security scan workflow and automated testing pipeline significantly improve the project's reliability and maintainability as well

---

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
- Successfully implemented security scanning and automated testing workflows
- Completed non-code parsing integration ahead of schedule
- Comprehensive workflow planning provided clear direction for the team
- Good collaboration on integration tasks
- Effective time management across multiple pipeline tasks

**What Could Be Improved:**
- more meeting times from the subgroup so we are all on the same page specially for the flow
- Can imporve on replying back to the subgroup discussion points and addressing the important messages on priority PRs as i have been blocked on major things this week 
- Need better coordination on review timelines for pipeline changes

---

### Plan for Next Cycle
- Complete matching inputs and outputs of independent flows - Majorly
- Colaborate on the flow for the project and put the tasks together
- Address review feedback on CI pipeline and verification linking tasks
- Add Docker build to CI pipeline
- Implement test coverage reporting
- Optimize pipeline performance
