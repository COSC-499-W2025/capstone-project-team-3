### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* Good PR reviews this week. We were able to merge a lot of PRs and the reading break gave us all a bit of time to develop a bit more.

**What Could Be Improved:**
* We need to align on what the final key priorities for M1 are since the due date is near approaching to ensure our effort & time is being used efficiently. 
* We still need to be able to intergrate the flow of our project in main. Not always entirely sure who's doing what and why.
