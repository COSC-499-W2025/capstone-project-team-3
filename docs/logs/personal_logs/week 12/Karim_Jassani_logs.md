- created function to extract number of PR reviewd and merged for a given user from a given git repo
- collaborated with team to draft entire project code flow
- attended team meetings
- reviewed team velocity and planned next week which is crucial


---

### Recap of Weekly Goals

#301 - Calculate user's PR Metrics

- **In Progress this week:**
  - Use PR metrics to calculate project rank.
  - Write and retrieve project rank from DB.

### Additional Context (Optional)
- This week, I made strong progress on the project by creating the criteria for our project ranking system and implementing a function to extract PR metrics (specifically the number of PRs merged and reviewed—using the GitHub API). I collaborated closely with the team to outline the full project code flow and align our development direction. I also attended team meetings, contributed to discussions around velocity, and helped plan priorities for the upcoming critical week. Overall, I successfully completed my assigned feature (#301) and supported the team’s momentum moving forward.
