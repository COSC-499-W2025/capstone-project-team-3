![Personal Log](../../../screenshots/Week%2012%20Personal%20Log-%20Oluwadabira.png)

---

### Recap of Weekly Goals
- Wrapping up parsing logic for code files:
- - Implementation of extracting file entities which includes classes, functions, and components
- - Implementation of extracting code_metrics
- - Implementation of the flow for checking code file and then parsing
---

### Features Assigned to Me
- Parsing code (non-git) files:
- - Extract file entities
- - Extract metrics
- - Normalize imports
- - Flow implementation

### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**  
    - Completion of extracting file entities:
    - - Extracting classes
    - - Extracting functions
    - - Extracting components


- **In Progress this week:**  
    - Extracting metrics
    - Integrating parse_code_utils flow
---

### Additional Context (Optional)

---

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
- The implementation of the in-progress tasks took longer than I envisioned with some hiccups along the way. It is finally on its last stretch. I had good support from my team on always confirming what should be expected and what might need to changed. The communication especially within the subgroup for code analysis was good
- My understanding of data structures and algorithms greatly improved while implementing this.

**What Could Be Improved:**
* I think our team could improve with communication, making sure all major decisions should be discussed with the group, being able to express concerns openly, and possibly also our time management.

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Pickup on dashboard creation and making sure flow from parsing -> analysis runs smoothly.
