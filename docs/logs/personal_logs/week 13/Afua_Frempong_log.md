### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* We were able to meet in person quite a few times this week and had lots of discussion. 
* We have aligned on the final overall project flow 

**What Could Be Improved:**
* Our discussion is often repetitive and conversation drags on when everyone has so many good points
* We need to make a team contract so that we are all aligned on how project development should occur.
