### Additional Context (Optional)
- Hoping to wrap up all requirements before the day of deadline

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
- I was able to gain more understanding of development practices the docker container.
- Discussion with teammates on code reviews as well as figuring out minor bugs and performance improvements.

**What Could Be Improved:**
* Establishing the agenda of our meeting on time; I think this would help avoid repeating conversations that have been discussed prior.
* Concrete meeting notes of things we agreed on; it would help alleviate new concerns or clarifying questions on what was discussed and agreed upon.

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Wrap up the requirements for this last stretch of our project.
