### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* We were able to meet in person quite a few times this week and had lots of discussion. 
* We were able to record our Milestone # 1 demo and troubleshoot as a group

**What Could Be Improved:**
* Time management & Task Delegation : I think we put an immense amount of effort and time into this milestone and I wonder if we need to adjust our work style in term 2
