### **Issue Descriptions for This Week**

---

#### **#401: Git Code Parsing**  
This PR introduces a new git_code_parsing module that extracts commit-level code history for the user’s Git email and integrates it into the main analysis flow. It updates main.py to automatically run Git-based parsing when a project is detected as a Git repo. Comprehensive tests were added to validate the parsing logic and ensure the main workflow correctly invokes Git parsing. Overall, this adds the foundation for Git-aware code analysis.

---

#### **PR #386: Project Score for Project Ranking**  
This PR adds a full scoring pipeline for evaluating project contributions across Git-based and non-Git codebases. It introduces normalized, capped metrics for code activity, documentation effort, and maintainability, along with logic to compute code/non-code contribution ratios. A final blended score (0–1) is produced based on weighted effort distribution. Comprehensive tests are included to validate normalization, saturation behavior, percentage calculations, and full integration paths.
