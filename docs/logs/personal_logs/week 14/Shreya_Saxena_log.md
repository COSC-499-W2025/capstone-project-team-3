### **Issue Descriptions for This Week**

---

#### **#396, #397, #405 (Integrated via PR #404)**  
Completed full integration of non-code analysis flows into `main()`, including both local heuristic-based analysis and AI-driven methods. Updated the non-code file checker output schema for consistency across modules and ensured compatibility with downstream portfolio generation along with testing.

---

#### **PR #404: Integrating non-code local analysis, non-code AI analysis, and updating outputs**  
Connected all non-code analysis stages into the complete end-to-end execution path. This PR resolved three major issues (#396, #397, #405) and established the final structure for incorporating non-code artifacts within the main orchestrator along with testing.

---

#### **PR #407: Add metrics to portfolio**  
Implemented portfolio metrics, improved bullet-point generation, standardized output formatting to include project names, and refined both AI and non-AI result fields.  
Closed related issues: **#411, #412, #409** along with testing.

---
#### **Final Presentation Work**
Collaborated with the team to prepare slides for the final presentation. I made slides for non code analysis for skills and additional metrics for non code pipeline. Reviewed all slides with the team.

#### **Final Demo Work** PR#409 FOR FINISHED PROJECT 
Collaborated with **Karim Khalil**, **Oluwadabira Omotoso**, and **Afua Frempong** to prepare the final project demo along with testing and the following: 

**Tasks completed:**  
- Wrote the **demo script** for my part.
- Outlined and verified all **completed project requirements** 
- Co-created the **demo video**  
- Implemented additional **tests and validation steps** to finalize the project for submission
