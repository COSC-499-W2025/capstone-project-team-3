### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* Our Data Flow Level 0 diagram was designed efficiently and we were able to agree on the high-level flow of data for our project
* We are all making time after class to further align on the direction of our project whenever there is a difference in process
* We are coming to a greater shared understanding of how to implement our requirements and how exactly we want thigns to work

**What Could Be Improved:**
* Once again, we did not make the most out of our meeting times, however each meeting concluded with all members being on the same page. Leveraging the work force of all 6 memebers and having round table discussion is crucial to the development of this project.
