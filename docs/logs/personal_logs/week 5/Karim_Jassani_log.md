### Additional Context (Optional)
- Discussing the data flow diagram with other teams was useful to get a broader understanding of how other teams are interpreting the applicaiton

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* Everyone brought in their ideas which made the discussion insightful and the process more efficient
* Learning from last week, we utilized our time in class better and were more efficient
* Group chemistry is good which makes discussions easier and more insightful

**What Could Be Improved:**
* DFD is supposed to be worked on as a whole, hence, it was difficult to divide the task. This is somehthing we can keep in mind for future weeks.

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Review base project requirements and make adjustments to requirements when necessary
* Finalise assigned tasks and set up project board
* Research more on our chosen tech stack and algorithms that will contribute to project development
