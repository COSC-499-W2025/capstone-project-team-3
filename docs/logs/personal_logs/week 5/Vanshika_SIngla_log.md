### Recap of Weekly Goals
- Reviewed the key concepts behind Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)  
- Created the Level 0 DFD to represent overall system context and major external entities  
- Developed the Level 1 DFD to show internal processes and data interactions more clearly  

---

### Features Assigned to Me
- Level 0 and Level 1 DFD creation and documentation  

---

### Associated Project Board Tasks
| Task/Issue ID | Title       | Status     |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| #N/A          | Level 0 DFD | Completed  |
| #N/A          | Level 1 DFD | Completed  |

### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**  
  - Strengthened understanding of how data and process flows are structured in DFDs  
  - Contributed to designing both Level 0 and Level 1 DFDs by first drawing the understanding sketch digitally and then finalizing it with the team
- **In Progress this week:**  
  - N/A

### Additional Context (Optional)
- Clarifing the doubts and seeking answers from professor Bowen really helped me understand the ambigious concepts

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**  
* Time management improved over last week
* Using class time intentionally for amendments and focused discussions kept workload balanced  
* Collaborated synchronously using shared whiteboard sketches before finalizing diagrams went smooth

**What Could Be Improved:**  
* We still had a few miscommunications that slowed down certain parts of the work  
* Define a “switch point” from group sketching to parallel work to avoid six people doing one low‑value step

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Review base project requirements and make adjustments to requirements when necessary  
* Finalise assigned tasks and set up project board  
* Research more on our chosen tech stack and algorithms that will contribute to project development
