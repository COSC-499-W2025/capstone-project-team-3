### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* Our team did a good job of requesting, taking in feedback and re-interating our processes and documentation in order to align with   project requiremeents. We were able to put in a lot of hours into reviewing documentation by working over the long weekend. This also shows our team has drive and is ready to make time in order to get things done. 
* We have a polished and finalized outline of our functional and non-functional requiremnts for the first milestone.


**What Could Be Improved:**
* For me, I would like to try and contribute to more code reviews next week and moving forward we should try and manage our project through setting standrd notations. For example, setting a standard naming convention for branches, outling relationships between tickets (feature, tasks, subtasks) and figuring out how to best utilize the kanban board & burn chart early on in development will help structure our work and avoid confusion I think if we also come to a consensus on what fields should always be populated when creating issues this will help is easily manage our project space.
