### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**  
  - Updated and finalized the System Architecture diagramsand its summary and use.  
  - created requirements.txt to manage dependecies well in collaboration
  - Collaborated with the team on refining documentation for Milestone 1  
- **In Progress this week:**  
  - Function to check if file is zip file, tests created need to write function (TDD)

### Additional Context (Optional)
- The architecture diagram and documentation updates helped clarify the system’s data flow and backend process design

### Reflection

**What Went Well:**  
* Productive collaboration and clear progress across multiple deliverables  

**What Could Be Improved:**  
* Clearer task ownership earlier in the week could have reduced overlap  
* More frequent commits could make version tracking smoother  
* Could have started earlier to avoid time crunch

---

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Begin refining and implementing the next **file upload functions**  
* Work on **decompression logic** to handle uploaded archive files  
* Continue improving architecture documentation as implementation progresses
