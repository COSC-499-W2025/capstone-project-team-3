### Recap of Weekly Goals
- Helped in refining DFD Level 1 diagram and documentation based on Milestone 1 requirements.
- Initialized the Python project structure for the backend, establishing a clean foundation for Milestone 1 development.
- Created the app package with entry points main.py and cli.py, ensuring both run successfully and serve as placeholders for future features.
- Added basic test cases (test_main.py and test_cli.py) to verify that the core scripts execute correctly and produce the expected output.
- Configured pytest with a pytest.ini file to resolve import issues and standardized the testing environment for all teammates.
- Updated the .gitignore to exclude environment files, caches, and temporary data for a cleaner repository.
- Verified that all components run correctly through the command line (python -m app.main, python -m app.cli, and pytest -v) and documented test instructions in tests/README.md

### Reflection

**What Went Well:**  
* We managed to split documentation refienment work efficiently to have done in a timely manner
* Everyone contributed to project kickoff with high quality code in a tight timeline
* Code reviews to prs have been taken seriously showing releveant comments and questions
* Productive collaboration and clear progress across multiple deliverables  


**What Could Be Improved:**  
* More PR review contributions to enable progress on blocked tasks.
* Completing tasks earlier for a buffer period to reflect or address a problem

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Begin to implement and complete consent form logic
* Allow the user to interact with cli to accpet/reject consent form and store result in local storage
* Kick start scanning and indexing files impolementation
