### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* Time management this week was really good, we were able to split up work accordingly.
* The base requirements provided really gave a clearer picture of our project and allowed us to make updates to our work more efficiently.

**What Could Be Improved:**
* As the project progesses, I will need to research more on Docker commands and container management.

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Continuing with code contributions, moving from UC2 to UC4
