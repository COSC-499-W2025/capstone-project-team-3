### Additional Context (Optional)

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* Our team did a good job of distrubuting workload and aligning on kanban and issue structure.
* We were also able to setup a streamlined PR system. I'm happy with how our development is progressing so far. 

**What Could Be Improved:**
* We could improve by figuring out how to progress issues when they inter-depend on one another. (Should we have a blocked section on our Project Board, or maybe work cross functionally, TBD). Since we all have different schedules, we need to find a way to work in pararrel without stalling one another.
