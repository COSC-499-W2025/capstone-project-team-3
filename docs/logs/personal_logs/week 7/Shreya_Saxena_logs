### Recap of Weekly Goals
- Completed all FR2 sub-issues on schedule:
  - **Validate Directory Read Access (#79):** Implemented `validate_read_access()` to verify folder and file readability, ensuring accurate permission and existence checks.
  - **Handle Invalid or Inaccessible Paths (#81):** Added error handling and structured response logic for invalid, missing, or unreadable directories.
  - **Handle Directory Size (#83):** Implemented `validate_directory_size()` to calculate total directory size and warn when exceeding defined limits.
  - **Test Cases (#86):** Added pytest coverage for all FR2 validators with edge case handling and consistent TDD workflow.

### Features Assigned to Me
- Folder Path Selector (FR2)
- File functions and unit tests

### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**  
  - Finalized and merged backend validation utilities for FR2, ensuring all modules passed unit testing.  
  - Followed **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** by first writing failing tests and then implementing passing logic for both read access and size validation.  
  - Reviewed and refined code for error handling and consistent return structures across all path utilities.  
  - Maintained active collaboration with teammates to ensure parallel PRs (Consent Management, Git Detection, ZIP Extraction) aligned with FR2 backend updates.  

- **In Progress this week:**  
  - Implementing logic for folder decompression. 
  - Reviewing documentation consistency for FR2 functions and related test references.  


---

### Additional Context (Optional)
- FR2 deliverables were **completed on time and within scope**, maintaining high testing standards.  
- The implemented validation logic establishes a strong foundation for the upcoming **File Scanning (FR4)** integration.  
- Consistent naming conventions, reusable utility structures, and standardized error responses were maintained for code quality.

### Reflection

**What Went Well:**  
* Delivered all assigned FR2 tasks on schedule with 100% test coverage.  
* Maintained strong communication with the team and code consistency across the backend module.  
* TDD workflow helped ensure robust and predictable code behavior.  


**What Could Be Improved:**  
* More frequent commits could make version tracking smoother  

---

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Start initial decompression logic to handle zipped project files.  
* Support teammates with their code, pr, reviews and documentation.
* Continue improving developer documentation and internal testing references.
