### Additional Context (Optional)
* Our DB needed to be seeded with data and have steps outlined for other memebrs to 
* We also took time to align on our DB Schema structure which was a blokcer for other issues like consent manage and user preference

---

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* Our team did a good job of aligning on overall Schema structure and how the flow of our configuration was going to work. These are important to discuss now so that we dont have to go back and change the way our code is written we can simply adjust what tables we need/dont need. I'm okay with how our development is progressing so far. 

**What Could Be Improved:**
* We could improve by having seperate chats for our PR reviews and figuring out how we wang our repository structure to exists (for example what needs to live where). 
* I want to close more issues next week in terms of dev to wrap up the consent management feature.
