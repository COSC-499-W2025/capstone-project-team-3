### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**  
  - Check for collaboration in a given git repo
  - Detect edge cases like empty git repo
  - Filtering given author's commits from repo
  - Conducted peer reviews for teammates code
  - Disscussed with teammate and agreed on task priorities for FR5: Git History Extraction 

- **In Progress this week:**  
  - Review and discuss DB schema with teammates


---

### Additional Context (Optional)
We have had multiple discussions regarding DB schema and it is evolving as we implement other functionalities.

---

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* We had good communication as a team and we were able to split up our work effectively.
* Code reviews have been productive, with team members providing constructive suggestions for improving each other’s code.
* Followed TDD effectively — all tests passed immediately after implementation.  

**What Could Be Improved:**
* Improve clarity around project structures and document meetings more to prevent future miscommunications.
*


### Plan for Next Cycle
* Extract the content from all the commits by a given author
* Integrate the workflow in the Project Input & Initialization module, including folder path selection, file scanning and indexing, and Git history extraction.
* Check for redundancy and refactor code to ensure efficiancy and clarity
