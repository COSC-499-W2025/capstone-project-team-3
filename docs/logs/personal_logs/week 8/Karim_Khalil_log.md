---

### Type of Tasks Worked On
- Backend development (File Scanning & Indexing – FR4)
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for file operations
- Accurate project and file signature generation
- Database integration for storing and checking signatures
- Test-driven development (pytest – error handling, retry, and DB checks)
- PR documentation, issue linking, and progress tracking
- Peer review and coordination across backend modules

---

### Recap of Weekly Goals
- Complete all remaining FR4 subtasks and align them with the final feature requirements.
- Ensure file scanning and signature logic works for duplicate detection and robust error handling.
- Write comprehensive unit tests before implementation (TDD).
- Finalize documentation and progress summaries for the File Scanning module.

---

### Features Assigned to Me
- **FR4:** File Scanning & Indexing
- **Signature Generation & Duplicate Detection**
- **Error Handling (I/O, Empty Folders, Retry)**
- **Test Coverage for Error and DB Utilities**

### Issue Descriptions for this week:

- **#77: Error Handling (I/O, Empty Folders, Retry)**  
  Implemented robust error handling for file operations, including handling missing files, permission errors, and empty folders. Added a retry mechanism to file signature extraction to improve resilience against transient I/O errors.

- **#76: Write Metadata to Local Database**  
  Enhanced logic to store both project and file signatures in the database after scanning. Ensured accurate and efficient saving of metadata for duplicate detection and analysis tracking.

- **#73: Extract & Store Metadata**  
  Refactored metadata extraction to support reliable signature generation and database integration. Improved extraction logic for file size, timestamps, and relative paths.

- **#70: Scan Files Paying Attention to Exclusions and Filters**  
  Updated file scanning logic to respect exclusion patterns and filters, ensuring only relevant files are processed and analyzed.

- **#78: Test Cases**  
  Developed and expanded unit tests to cover new error handling, retry logic, and database checks. Verified correctness and reliability through both manual and automated testing.

---

### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**  
  - Refactored file signature logic to use relative paths and metadata, with error handling and retry mechanism for transient I/O errors.
  - Implemented project signature generation based on file signatures for robust duplicate detection.
  - Added logic to handle empty folders and zipped archives with no content, skipping analysis when appropriate.
  - Integrated database logic to store and check file/project signatures for duplicate detection.
  - Expanded and updated unit tests to cover error handling, retry logic, and database checks.
  - Performed manual and automated testing to ensure reliability and correctness.

- **In Progress this week:**  
  - Collaborating on integration with other backend modules for seamless workflow.

---

### Additional Context (Optional)
- The new error handling and retry logic greatly improved the robustness of file scanning and signature extraction.
- Database schema and logic now fully support project and file signature storage and lookup for duplicate detection.
- All major FR4 subtasks are now completed and merged.

---

### Reflection

**What Went Well:**  
- Successfully implemented and tested error handling and retry mechanisms.
- Achieved reliable duplicate detection for projects and files using database checks.
- Maintained strong communication and collaboration with the team.
- PR reviews and testing were efficient and thorough.

**What Could Be Improved:**  
- Continue to increase commit frequency for better code tracking.

---

### Plan for Next Cycle
- Support integration of file scanning outputs with other backend modules.
- Continue monitoring and testing for edge cases.
- Begin work on next milestone features as assigned.
