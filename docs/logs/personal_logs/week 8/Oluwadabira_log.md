### Progress Summary

  - Methods that return list should be plural named
  - Fixed no tests ran result in Docker Env
  - Conducted peer reviews for teammates code
  - Disscussed with teammate and agreed on task priorities for FR5: Git History Extraction 

- **In Progress this week:**  
  - Fix Docker environment interactivity issue

---

### Additional Context (Optional)
The Docker PRs related to setup and interactivity may continue to be ongoing issues, primarily because as our project grows, it becomes harder to fully reproduce the environment in Docker.

---

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* We had good communication as a team and we were able to split up our work effectively.
* Code reviews have been productive, with team members providing constructive suggestions for improving each other’s code.

**What Could Be Improved:**
* Improve clarity around project structures and document meetings more to prevent future miscommunications.
---

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Continue working on the docker setup.
* Integrate the workflow in the Project Input & Initialization module, including folder path selection, file scanning and indexing, and Git history extraction.
* Research on how to execute content and visualisation analysis.
