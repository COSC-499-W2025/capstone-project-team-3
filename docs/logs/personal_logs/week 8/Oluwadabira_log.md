### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**  
  - Docker Coverage test setup
  - Detect .git folder
  - Extract commit metadata: commit hash, author name, commit data and time, and commit message

- **In Progress this week:**  
  - Extract commit metadata: Number of files changed, Lines added/deleted (contribution from the user) and their file types, and Branch information

---

### Additional Context (Optional)

The reason this issue is still in progress is because there are still some parts such as the Number of files changed, Lines added/deleted (contribution from the user) and their file types, and Branch information that have yet to be implemented. I am still researching how I am implementing this.

---

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* We had good communication as a team and we were able to split up our work effectively.
* Code reviews have been going well. Everyone has been giving positive suggestions on where to change or improve someone else's code.

**What Could Be Improved:**
* As the project progesses, I will need to research more on Docker commands and container management.
---

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Continue working on FR5 which includes:
- The completion of extract commit metadata
- Storing the commit metadata to the local database
- Mapping changes to files
- Handling missing or empty .git repos
