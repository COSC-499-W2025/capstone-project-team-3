### Type of Tasks Worked On
![Personal Log](../../../screenshots/Shreya_Saxena_week-8.png)

---

### Type of Tasks Worked On
- Backend development (Folder Path Selector – FR2)
- ZIP Extraction and Project Detection utilities
- Test-driven development (pytest – validation & extraction)
- PR documentation, issue linking, and progress tracking
- Peer review and coordination across backend modules
- Updating feature documentation and summary tables

---

### Recap of Weekly Goals
- Complete all remaining FR2 subtasks and align them with the final feature requirements.  
- Ensure ZIP extraction and project identification logic works for multiple projects in uploaded archives.  
- Write comprehensive unit tests before implementation (TDD).  
- Finalize documentation and progress summaries for the Folder Path Selector module.

---

### Features Assigned to Me
- **FR2:** Folder Path Selector  
- **Project Extraction & Identification Utilities** (`extract_and_list_projects`, `_identify_projects`)  
- **Test Coverage for Validation Utilities**

### Issue Descriptions for this week:
- **#153: Project Identification from ZIPs**  
  Added `extract_and_list_projects()` to handle ZIP extraction, error handling, and automatic project listing for downstream modules.  

- **#86: Test Cases for Validation & Extraction Utilities**  
  Comprehensive pytest coverage added following TDD, including valid, invalid, and edge case scenarios.  

- **#139: Read the Number of Projects Uploaded by the User**  
  Implemented `_identify_projects()` utility to detect valid projects within extracted ZIPs based on standard project markers (e.g., `setup.py`, `package.json`, `.git`).  

---

### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**  
  - Implemented and tested extraction and identification utilities for project uploads.  
  - Ensured consistent error handling, validation, and integration with FR2 modules.  
  - Updated progress documentation and verified all FR2 subtasks are now ✅ Completed.  
  - Conducted peer reviews for related modules (Consent, Git Detection, etc.) and provided feedback.  

- **In Progress this week:**  
  - Documentation finalization for FR2 and its alignment with FR4 (File Scanning).  
  - Preparing for next milestone: validation integration and scanning coordination.

---

### Additional Context (Optional)
- FR2 backend feature set is now **fully complete**.  
- Established strong modular structure, reusable utilities, and standardized return schemas.  
- All functions verified and merged through passing tests and reviews.  

---

### Reflection

**What Went Well:**  
- Completed all FR2 subtasks successfully and on time.  
- Maintained 100% test coverage through TDD.  
- Ensured seamless integration of ZIP handling with existing validation logic.  
- Actively reviewed and documented peer contributions for overall feature consistency.  

**What Could Be Improved:**  
- Dedicated weekly meeting time. 

---

### Plan for Next Cycle
- Transition focus to **FR4: File Scanning Integration**.  
- Support teammates in connecting folder validation outputs to scanning workflows.  
- Continue maintaining testing discipline and structured documentation.

---
* Followed TDD effectively — all tests passed immediately after implementation.  
* Improved understanding of ZIP handling, directory traversal, and Python file I/O edge cases.  

**What Could Be Improved:**  
* More commits could lead to easier code tracking. 

---

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Start with code logic for file analysis.
* Collaborate on PR reviews for related backend utilities.  
* Begin setting up test environments for end-to-end validation of the Project Input workflow.
