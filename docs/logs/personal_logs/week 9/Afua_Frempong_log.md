### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* We coded with a sense of urgency and were able to centralize last minute PRs and align on the necessity for non code and code analysis team breakdown.

**What Could Be Improved:**
* Our team seems to run into similar misunderstands in regards to who ius doing what. We need to be able to come to a consensus and equally distribute workload based on interests but also capacity.
