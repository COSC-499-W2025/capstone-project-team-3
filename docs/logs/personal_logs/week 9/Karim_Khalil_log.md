### Type of Tasks Worked On
- Backend development (FR6.2: Code Content Analysis)
- Non LLM code analysis kick-start
- Researching on code analysis algorithms
- LLM Gemini integration & setup
- Documentation
- Test-driven development (pytest)
- PR documentation, issue linking, and progress tracking
- Peer review and coordination across backend modules

---

### Recap of Weekly Goals
- Created a draft for non llm analysis skill / frameworks extraction
- Completed LLM code analysis to extract skills / frameworks from local and git projects
- Visualizing results in a resume like bullet-point structure on the CLI

---

### Features Assigned to Me
- Code Content Analysis (UC6.2)
- **NLP for Skill/Framework Extraction**
- **Aggregate Analysis Per File/Project**
- **Test Coverage for analysis functions**

### Issue Descriptions for this week:

- **#169: Code analysis - using AI**  
  Integrate & setup Gemini api to consume key information being passed after parsing process to produce resume like bullet points summarizing the work done by the user for local & git projects .


---

### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**  
  - Completed LLM analysis on code projects for local & git project producing resume like bullet points with metrics extracted
  - Kick started the non llm analysis using the metrics provided from the parsing process such as number of code lines, programming languages used, and roles identified using clues
  - Created unit tests for all functions created.
  - Setup LLM gemini class that can be used to call api with prompts. 
  - Added documentations to replicate output

- **In Progress this week:**  
  - Research and complete non llm analysis for code files to produce relevant and accurate information.
  - Integrate file scans into project flow
---

### Additional Context (Optional)
- Integration of the file scans is still pending due to previous tasks that would need to be merged into the main flow. 
---

### Reflection

**What Went Well:**  
- Great progress on project overall.
- 

**What Could Be Improved:**  
- Completing tasks earlier during the week can help us progress faster with the project. 

---

### Plan for Next Cycle
- Fine-tune a local analysis algorithm
- Continue improving the overall flow of the application
- Continue monitoring and testing for edge cases.
- Begin work on next milestone features as assigned.
