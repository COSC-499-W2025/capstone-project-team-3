### Additional Context (Optional)

---

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
* We had good communication as a team and we were able to split up our work effectively.
* Code reviews have been productive, with team members providing constructive suggestions for improving each other’s code.
* I learnt so much about the Tree sitter library and AST parsing and was able to implement the logic on my own fully offline
* Learnt more about pytest- mocking, 

**What Could Be Improved:**
* Improve clarity around project structures and document meetings more to prevent future miscommunications.
---

### Plan for Next Cycle
* Continue work on parse coding files
* Integrate the workflow in the Project Input & Initialization module, including folder path selection, file scanning and indexing, and Git history extraction.
