# 🧾 Personal Log – Shreya Saxena  
**Week of Nov 3 – Nov 9, 2025**

---

### 🔹 Type of Tasks Worked On
- Started research on approaches for implementing **non-code analysis without AI or 3rd-party services**.  
- Worked on code for file detection, directory scanning, and testing infrastructure.

---

### 🔹 Recap of Weekly Goals
- Finalize the foundational structure for non-code analysis file checker.  
- Begin outlining possible local summarization and topic-extraction methods.  
- Keep repository structure and PR flow aligned with Milestone #1.

### 🔹 Progress Summary
- Conducted literature and library review suitable for summarizing non-code artifacts wihtout Ai/3rd party services.  
- Drafted design functions for pre-processing and aggregation stages to support future local analysis.  
- Ensured consistent folder restructuring and dependency tracking for the new `non_code_analysis` module.  

---

### 🔹 Reflection
**What Went Well**  
- Productive research discussions and clear path forward for non-AI summarization.  
- Strong alignment of tasks with milestone tracking and previous PR foundations.  
- Good collaboration and feedback from code reviews.  

**What Could Be Improved**  
- Document intermediary research findings in the project wiki for reference.  

---

### 🔹 Plan for Next Cycle
- Continue research on **offline NLP models** (Sumy LSA vs TextRank).  
- Begin lightweight benchmarking of summarization quality.  
- Prepare draft implementation notes for the aggregation and analysis steps.
