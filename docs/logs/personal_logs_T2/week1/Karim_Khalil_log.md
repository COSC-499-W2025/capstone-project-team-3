### Issue Descriptions

Enhanced the code analysis pipeline with user preference integration to improve data quality and relevance for career-targeted analysis. This feature allows the system to prioritize keywords, patterns, and resume bullets based on the user's industry and job title preferences without breaking existing functionality.

Key implementations:
- Added user preference loading system that gracefully handles missing user data
- Implemented preference-weighted keyword prioritization for better relevance
- Enhanced resume bullet generation with industry/job-specific targeting
- Added pattern prioritization based on user career goals
- Refactored hardcoded pattern mappings to shared tech_patterns.py file for better maintainability

#436 – Code Analysis Enhancement

Closed by implementing the user preference system in PR #428. The enhancement improves the relevance and targeting of code analysis results for different career paths and industries.

### Progress Summary
- **Completed this week:**
Successfully enhanced the code analysis pipeline with user preference integration. Implemented preference-weighted keyword prioritization and industry/job-specific resume bullet enhancement. Refactored hardcoded pattern mappings to a shared tech_patterns.py file and added comprehensive documentation comments. Created PR #428 which received positive feedback and is currently under review.

### Reflection
**What Went Well:**
- Successfully designed and implemented user preference system with backward compatibility
- Effective refactoring of hardcoded patterns improved maintainability
- Comprehensive documentation added per reviewer feedback

**What Could Be Improved:**
- Better initial documentation could have prevented need for follow-up commit
