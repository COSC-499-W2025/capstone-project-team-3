### Connection to Previous Week

Previous week I completed the API integration and score breakdown utils - this week I am implementing the CLI for the functionality so it is easier to demo
---

### Pull Requests Worked On

- **[PR #703 - CLI for Project Score Override](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-3/pull/703)** 
  - Added end-to-end CLI flow for score inspection and override management (project selection, breakdown view, preview, apply, clear). 
  - Introduced structured ranking submenu with explicit override options for clearer user interaction. 
  - Improved breakdown readability with per-metric details (current value, full-score threshold, % to full score, weight, contribution) and converted output to plain-English formatting.
