## Week-7, Entry for Feb 16 → Feb 22, 2026, Reading break

---

### Connection to Previous Week
Building on the consent API backend work from previous weeks, I focused on implementing the complete consent management UI during reading break. This included creating the consent page UI, integrating it with backend APIs, implementing revoke consent functionality, and adding comprehensive API documentation for consent, resume, and project endpoints. I also worked on presenation and finalizing everything for it. 
NOTE: I know this was a bonus week, so feel free to add any extra flowing work in next weeks
