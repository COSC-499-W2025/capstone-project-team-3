### Connection to Previous Week
Building on the consent management UI work from reading break, I focused on critical bug fixes for non-code file analysis and refactoring the parsing logic to ensure collaborative files are properly analyzed. I also dedicated significant time to video demo preparation, testing, and reviewing team PRs to ensure quality for Milestone 2 delivery.

## Work Breakdown

### Coding Tasks

* **PR #733 – Non-Code Parsing Refactor:** Refactored non-code file parsing logic to ensure collaborative files (PDFs, READMEs, text files) are fully parsed and analyzed, fixed critical bug preventing analysis of collaborative non-code files, updated parsing flow to properly handle different file types, improved overall analysis accuracy for documentation contributions.

---

### Testing & Debugging Tasks

* Debugged collaborative non-code file analysis issues
* Tested refactored parsing logic across different file types (PDF, README, text)
* Validated that collaborative files are now properly analyzed
* Extensive testing for video demo preparation
* Tested consent management functionality for desktop application
* Regression testing to ensure parsing changes don't break existing functionality

---

### Collaboration & Review Tasks

* Extensive PR reviews for team members to ensure quality
* Recorded parts for video demo (#736)
* Collaborated on video demo preparation and script
* Participated in testing sessions for Milestone 2 features
* Provided feedback on multiple PRs across frontend and backend
* Coordinated with team on bug fixes and feature completions
* Supported team members with integration issues

---

### Issues & Blockers

**Issue Encountered:**

* Critical bug where collaborative non-code files were not being analyzed at all
* Complex refactoring required to fix parsing logic without breaking existing functionality
* Time management between bug fixes, video demo prep, and PR reviews
* Ensuring all changes are properly tested before Milestone 2 delivery
