## Reflection
* Individual reflections present in the personal logs 

During this week, our team deepened our understanding of system data flow and collaboration in Lucidchart. Translating high-level project ideas into DFD diagrams helped clarify how our dashboard components interact. We learned the importance of consistent naming conventions and clear process boundaries to prevent confusion in later design stages.

## Plan for Next Cycle
* Update repo README with link to system final system architecture diagram with explanation
* Update repo README with link to DFD Level 1 with explanation
* Update repo README with link to revised WBS
* Explore Docker for the system setup 
- Finalize assigned tasks and set up the GitHub Project Board for tracking.
- Research frameworks and tools for metadata extraction and timeline visualization.
