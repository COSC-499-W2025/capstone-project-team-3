## Reflection
* Individual reflections present in the personal logs 


This week went really well — we wrapped up all planned tasks, including setting up Docker, starting the Python project, and getting the database in place. We also cleaned up our diagrams and documentation after getting helpful feedback from the professor. Everyone contributed, and using the project board made it easy to stay organized. Overall, we’re in a good spot to move on to the next phase, focusing on UC1, UC2, and UC4.

## Plan for Next Cycle
* Continue with code contributions, prioritising and finalising UC 1, 2, and 4.
